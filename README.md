# Twitter-Sentiment-Self-Driving-Cars
 ML1 Individual FP - A machine learning project analyzing Twitter sentiment on self-driving cars in the US using the 2015 dataset.

 This is an individual final project for Machine Learning 1 by the current MSDS FT Academic Program Director, Prof. Kenneth Co.

Key Features of the Project

1. Data Transformation
Steps performed:
Handling missing values.
Removing special characters, hyperlinks, and punctuation.
Converting text to lowercase.
Tools used: pandas, re.
2. Feature Engineering
Used TF-IDF vectorization to extract features from the text.
Preprocessed text for input into the sentiment analysis model.
3. Model Training
Algorithm used: Logistic Regression.
Implemented with scikit-learn.
Trained on 80% of the data and validated on 20%.
4. Model Inference
Predictions were made on test data to evaluate sentiment.
Provided a few example predictions for interpretation.
5. Model Validation
Evaluation metrics:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1-score
